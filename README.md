# Multiple Linear Regression Projects

This repository contains data analysis projects using **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** in RStudio. Each project uses a real dataset and applies regression techniques to make predictions and understand variable relationships.

## ðŸ”¥ 1. Fire Area Prediction

**Objective**: Predict the burned area of forest fires in Portugal using weather-related variables.

**Dataset**: Meteorological data including temperature, humidity, wind, and dryness indexes from the Montesinho natural park.

**Highlights**:
- Log transformation of target variable (`area`)
- Exploratory data analysis using pair plots and histograms
- Polynomial regression for improved model fit
- Model diagnostics and prediction

## ðŸ’° 2. Earnings Analysis

**Objective**: Predict earnings based on demographic factors such as education, age, and gender.

**Highlights**:
- Handling categorical predictors
- Building and interpreting a linear model
- Checking assumptions and diagnosing the model

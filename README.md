## ðŸ”¥ 1. Fire Area Prediction

**Objective**: Predict the burned area of forest fires in Portugal using weather-related variables.

**Dataset**: Meteorological data including temperature, humidity, wind, and dryness indexes from the Montesinho natural park.

**Highlights**:
- Log transformation of target variable (`area`)
- Exploratory data analysis using pair plots and histograms
- Polynomial regression for improved model fit
- Model diagnostics and prediction
